<h2>Specialty Dishes</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<em><strong>Kentuckey Style Fried Pigeon</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>Fried Chicken is simply not crunchy enough. We take a large helping of whole pigeons and fry them to golden brown in a corn bread batter with a secret blend of spices. Served with red-skin mashed potatoes with herb gravy, pinneaple coleslaw, and buttermilk biscuits.</em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>4 Layer Turduckin</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>As you may know, a turduckin is a chicken, stuffed in a duck, which is then stuffed in a turkey for triple the meat. We do ours a very special way. We marinade each 3 of the birds in a mango habanero marinade with hints of citrus. After cooking the turduckin, we stuff the resulting bird in a puffy pastry shell stuffed with sharp cheddar cheese, poblano peppers, caramelized onions, and brown sugar-chipotle glazed strips of bacon. Many flavors work at once here. Comes with vegetable medley, rice pilaf, and mashed sweet potatoes. </em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Steak Hamburger</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>This is a Hamburger with a premium cut boneless ribeye as the patty. Is stuffed between two pieces of fresh baked cheddar jalapeno bread and is topped with mango salsa, grilled portobella mushrooms, smoked gouda cheese, and a raspberry, horseradish, dijon mustard sauce. Is quite filling and flavorful at the same time and comes with beer battered onion rings and steak fries.</em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Seafood &amp; Chips</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>We take a special take on traditional fish and chips. Instead of only including our signature fried haddock in panko breadcrumbs, we also fry up lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, and calamari to add some variety with every bite. Comes with steak fries, jalapeno coleslaw, and malt vinegar infused tartar sauce for dipping.</em>
<dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Asian Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>While you are used to traditional meat sauce at home, we like to spice ours up Asian style. We start with spaghetti, Chinese spiced meatballs, Italian sausage, and veal cutlet, then simmer in a Asian style tomato sauce with ginger, garlic, hoisin sauce, oregano, and cilantro and top with mozzarella cheese, wonton skins, and barbacue spareribs. Comes with garlic bread, pork fried rice, our signature Asian citrus chicken and shrimp salad, and a Thai chili vegetable stirfry.</em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Greek Curry Pot Pie</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>A pot pie that is spicy and has many unique Mediterranean and Indian flavors coming together. Has a garlic naan pie crust and is stuffed with a spicy indian curry sauce, chicken, lamb, potatoes, feta cheese, tomatoes, red onions, and a lemon-indian chili tzaziki sauce. Comes with a greek salad, rice pilaf, and chicken samosas.</em>
<dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Steak &amp; Tuna Tartare Combo</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>A dish for those seeking a different kind of food experience. We flame sear premium grass fed beef and ahi tuna and slice thinly atop a plate of rice mixed with kosher pickles, ginger, soy sauce, and pearl onions. Comes with a side of seaweed salad and also wasabi and dijon mustard dipping sauces.</em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Korean BBQ Borscht</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>We think this well known soup could be spiced up a bit. We take Korean bbq fried chicken pieces and stir into a beet and green pepper borscht. We include pork rinds, onions, kimchi, and dollops of sour cream on this soup dish. Served with a side of kimchi braised pork and rice side, and grilled potatoes lathered in Korean bbq sauce.</em>
</dd>
<dt>
<em><strong>Pretzel Pizza</strong></em>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>Who said you couldn't make a pizza out of bavarian pretzel dough? Thats exactly what this pizza is. We take dough used to make bavarian soft pretzels, and make a pizza crust. We use stone ground german mustard instead of tomato sauce and top with a mozzarella, cheddar, danish blue cheese blend and have pepperoni, bratwurst, a multicolored blend of peppers and onions, shitake mushrooms, and sauerkraut. Is finished off with a side order of buffalo wings and steak fries to make this a perfect dish when watching a game on one of our tv's.</em>

<h2>Information about The Best Restaurant Around</h2>
<p>
While our name may sound corny to outsiders, our frequent customers will tell you about the quality of service and food we show everyday. Look below to learn more about us.
</p>
<br>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This restaurant is a 4th generation family operated establishment started by a man who wanted to bring customers a different dining experience. Our earlier generations of the family often had a hard time putting food on the table, and seldom had the chance to eat food that tasted good or differed from the mainstream American diet. Thus, when our Great Grandfather Andy and Great Grand Uncle Anderson got the chance to open a restaurant, they wanted to produce the best food around, hence, The Best Restaurant Around. Initially, the menu was quite limited reserved to tradional American fare such as meatloaf and hotdog plates. Over the years, we have created a new method to success, not letting our menu be limited to any particular type and more free to add unique dishes as we invent them. As we continued to profit from this unique take on food, we were able to take our once small 1 floor restaurant that could only serve 100 people at a time into a 10 floor establishment that could seat up to 20,000 customers at once. We hope you continue the traditions of those before you and enjoy the best food around at the best restaurant around this area.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
We aim as a business to use the freshest ingredients possible and have several storage facilities engineered to keep food fresh for decades or even centuries whether being picked in the fields or cut by one of our skilled butchers. Additionally, our family based team of chefs have followed a principle that reflects what we serve you here: Cook what you please, which results in us inventing unique dishes with flavors you will never forget and will come back for more. As we do not have any preferences in the food we serve, you should expect all items you find on our menu today to be permanent along with new additions every month, leading to &infin; possibilities. Expect dishes that at other places may cost $20+ to be half the cost or less here. We really don't expect our customers to visit any other establishment as The Best Restaurant Around really is the best restaurant in the area.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>
To compliment our great cuisine, we consider a comfortable atmosphere a essential aspect of satisfying customers. We have premium furniture that is comfortable and will make you want to stay for hours. The decor is colorful and inventive crafted by local artisans using the finest materials. We also have televisions for every table that have a volume system that will allow only people at one table to hear the tv at the table to prevent noise pollution at nearby tables. Our staff also ensures cleanliness is at a all-time high and will keep everything spotless while you eat with us. We also have live entertainment every night with many talented performers and musicians. Also, we have 10 floors of dining space with 2 of them with space for nighttime entertainment.
