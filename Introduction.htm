<h1>Introduction</h1>

<img src='intro_c.jpg' width="500px">

<p>Age of Empires is a series of historical real-time strategy video games, originally developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios. </p>
<p>The first title of the series was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Seven titles and three spin-offs have been released. </p>
<p>Age of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. </p>
<p>The Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. </p>
<p>A Fourth Installment, Age of Empires IV has been announced without any information about it released yet.</p>
<h2>What's there to expect in Age of Empires III?</h2>

<p>We could go on for pages listing the new improvements and features, but among the major additions are the Home City, Trade Routes, and the Native American tribes/ Minor Asian Civilizations. </p>

<h2>What civilizations are in Age of Empires III and its Expansions?</h2>

<h2>What am I going to see graphics-wise in Age of Empires III?</h2>

<p>Age of Empires III's design team at Ensemble Studios promised a breathtaking advance in RTS graphics, and they have definitely delivered. AoE III will feature a heavily modified Bang! engine, which features a lot of top-notch stuff, such as:</p>

<br clear="all">

Havok 2 Physics Engine: Havok is a physics engine used by many FPS (First Person Shooter) games available today, such as Halo 2, Half Life 2, and Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault. Havok is quite popular with game designers, and it's the best physics engine available today. It will make things more realistic in AoE III.</p>

<br clear="all">

Shaders: Modern general-purpose consumer computer processors (CPUs, such as the Pentium 4 and Athlon) are comparatively slow at complex math operations, making large-scale math-intensive graphical effects impractical for high-performance operation. Graphics cards, however, are extremely good at performing these math operations quickly. Shaders allow some of this graphics work to be offloaded from the CPU to the GPU (graphics card). A few older cards had a primitive version of shaders, called register combiners, but these were short-lived as full shaders followed quickly.</p>

<br clear="all">

Newer versions of shader support on graphics cards allow more complex programs, increasing the amount of work which can be offloaded to the GPU.

<br clear="all">

Vertex Shader 3: Vertex Shaders operate on the geometry of objects, which is made of many points called vertices which define the shape of the object. Vertex Shaders are simply small programs which run on the graphics card, performing these operations. Vertex Shaders typically are given the task of transforming objects into screen space (from 3D to 2D), skinning objects, primitive lighting, and similar tasks.</p>

<br clear="all">

Pixel Shader 3: Like Vertex Shaders, Pixel Shaders are small programs that run on the graphics card. Like its namesake, these programs operate on individual pixels. These programs do things such as texturing an object, advanced lighting, reflections, and other effects that make the game more visually appealing.</p>

<h2>Critic Reviews</h2>
<p>"An absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off." - Game Spy</p>
<p>"Balanced, innovative, gorgeous. Truly worthy of the series." - PC Gamer</p>
<p>"Eventually even the most diehard series zealots are going to begin to ask themselves why they are still in the same place playing the same game they were playing nearly a decade ago. While the genre has grown, the series that helped to spearhead games of this type into the public eye has stayed disturbingly static." - eToyChest</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<p>There is hidden files in the Age of Empires 3 directory that confirm that the Swedes, Italians, and Koreans were almost added to the game as civilizations. Maybe when you start modding, you will add these. In additional, there is other interesting un-added content such as a supposed cheat unit the gatling camel, which mods such as King's Return and Wars of Liberty have implemented into their mod's Persian Civilization as well as other Middle Eastern nations.</p>
<p>Much of Age of Empires 3's assets were taken directly out of Age of Mythology, the first 3d Age of Empires title released before Age of Empires 3. Some models from that game can even be imported through modding such as the egyptian and greek building models.</p>
<p>Some resources in game are not currently used, such as fame allowing modders like you to create additional resources from these.</p>
<p>While it may seem like features only belong to specific cultures, much work from the unhardcode patch has allowed modders to take assets from one culture and transplant it to others.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard windows addition of Age of Empires 3, Big Games released a version for Mac OSX. However, the files it uses differ somewhat from Windows. Thus mods for Windows and Mac OSX Age of Empires 3 differ in requirements.</p>
