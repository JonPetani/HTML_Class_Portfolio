		<h3>Advice When Attending Performance</h3>
		<hr>
               <p>
In General, you should try to get a reservation on these days as the restaurant gets quite packed when such a great band comes to perform. We recommend giving us 24-48 hours in advance since we may not find a table for you otherwise. When the band is playing, try not be a distration or you will be asked to leave (Especially don't try to get on stage or come near the band members). Don't mind the armed guards we hire at these events for both the safety of the performers and of our customers. If you can, invite people you know to be in one party, so we can seat you all at one table to avoid the loss of space for additional parties.</p>
