<h2>What this page has to show</h2>
<p>This page shows all 3 websites Jonathan has coded over the course of a semester. The order at which they are shown is from first done to last. This is the most vital page to see if you want to see Jonathan's work in action.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Website</h2>
<img class = 'Site' src='Erestaurant.png' width='100' height='100' alt='restaurant webpage'/>
<h3>What is this site</h3>
<p align=left>This was the first website Jonathan produced. It was about a restaurant called the best restaurant around. The overall goal was to present a restaurant themed website. It was designed to cater towards the many customers that would visit this site such that they would visit the establishment.</p>
<h3>What was gained from making this site</h3>
<p align=left>The content reflects a actual restaurant website. There are 4 main pages. The first is a home page that has all the basic information from specialty dishes to descriptive information about the establishment's atmosphere. The specials page shows one daily special served at the establishment. The third page shows a performer who will be performing at the establishment. The last page shows a table of all future performers and the relevant dates.</p>
<h3>Wait, aren't I already in the EPortfolio right now?</h3>
<p align=left>This was the first website created, thus it has many beginner techniques involved in the color scheme and overall design. As he applied more html and css skills, Jonathan was able to improve the visual assets and also fix many long standing bugs in the way images wrapped the text.</p>

<h2>Final Project Website</h2>
<img class = 'Site' src='FinalProj.png' width='100' height='100' alt='final project webpage'/>
<h3>What is this site</h3>
<p align=left>This was the second website Jonathan produced. It was a Age of Empires 3 modding website. It was meant to act as a database for future modders of the pc game Age of Empires 3. This site was meant to be more insightful to newcomers than other sites with different features that would help tailor help to a individual rather than a crowd.</p>
<h3>What this site contains</h3>
<p align=left>There are really two categories of pages that compose this site. One type are information pages such as the homepage, the info page, the FAQ, and the flag making tutorial. The other type are form pages such as the mod specifications form and the background form which were meant to be surveys to the user to be mailed to the website's server allowing developers to tailor tutorials and summaries for individuals rather than larger groups of modders. Of course the site would have general modding information pages like the flag page, but the forms were there to make the site cater to all people interested in the topic as well as others.
<h3>What was gained from making this site</h3>
<p align=left>This site was designed using more images than typical. The site design came together nicely compared to the previous site. The site itself in this situation was a product meant to educate people. Thus, the site was not only meant to be informational, but also interactive with the user with tools to help them in their endeavors. Writing the text content and finding good images was quite simple as Jonathan was familiar with the subject. The site is overall very informational.</p>

<h2>Electronic Portfolio Website</h2>
<img class = 'Site' id='E' src='EPort.png' width='100' height='100' alt='final project webpage'/>
<h3>What is this site</h3>
<p align=left>This is Jonathan's EPortfolio site. This is meant to summarize all 3 projects Jonathan produced including the portfolio itself. The site is focused more on Jonathan himself and his accomplishments.</p>
<h3>What this site contains</h3>
<p align=left>Here you can find links to all 3 of Jonathan's websites and also summaries about them. It is a good place to start if you are unfamiliar in Jonathan's past work. By reading the content, you will gain a appreciation of Jonathan Petani's work in web development. Not only that, this site also highlights some of Jonathan's other skills beyound his html, css, and javascript experience.</p>
<h3>What was gained from making this site</h3>
<p align=left>This project can be thought of as putting everything together. It is a true symbol of all of Jonathan's efforts in web development. Thus, much of the individual tasks were very simple. It was putting it all together that took some pre-thought. Overall, the layout is impressive for all the skill and experience that went into it. The EPortfolio taught Jonathan how to use a webpage to advertise skills to future employers. When adding features, thoughts about how it would look to the viewer came to mind. The original color scheme was very spring like, but this blue one for instance seems more objective to the purpose of the project.</p>
<h3>Wait, aren't I already in the EPortfolio right now?</h3>
<p align=left>It actually is. The thing is, this website is meant to summarize all of Jonathan's websites. This includes the E Portfolio itself, thus it gets it's own summary. The summary is useful if you never visited this site before.</p>
