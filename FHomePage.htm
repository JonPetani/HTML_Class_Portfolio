<h2>What is our Purpose?</h2>
<p align = 'left'>We have you fill out a form detailed what kind of a game experience you are looking for (new units, new buildings, new civilization, reworks or overhauls of existing content) and provide you specially tailored information to suit your needs. This is done by submitting two forms. One to tell us what you want to do with your mod, and another to detail us of your past experiences in programming, graphic design, and any potential experience in modding a game in the past. We will email you information with language and detail that reflects your ambitions and background. Thats what sets us apart from other sites.</p>
<br>
<h2>What We Also Do</h2>

<p align = 'left'>We also have generalized pages on our site that provide overviews of various topics. Unlike other websites, we provide more links, tutorials, and even sample files to make sure you go from a novice to a expert overnight. We tailor these sample files of programs and png files to give you a real understanding of the subject and yes, we provide plenty of comments on our work.</p>

<h2>A little about us</h2>
<p>This website was started by individuals who want to bring the artform of Age of Empires 3 modding to everyone. The more mods that exist, the more we can not only create our own strategy games based on the Age of Empires 3 engine, but we indrectly add value to Age of Empires 3 itself honoring as the wonderful real-time strategy game it is.</p>
<p>While you may have viewed modding tutorials before, ours are targeted to those without a programming/computer science background.</p>
<p>The developers of this website have seen some fantastic fan made modifications of this game over the past 10-15 years. Even though the game was created back in 2005, the fanbase is still large allowing any creation of yours to reach a much wider audience than you may expect.</p>
<p>We have ourselves attempted modding on a few occasions. We found the road to a finished product bumpy and unpaved even for those with a software background. We often found ourselves having to ask experts who had little patience or care for those that did not pick up on the material right away. Of course you will need patience, creativity and originallity to make a successful Age of Empires 3 mod, but wouldn't it be nice if there was real teacher there to facilitate your learning?</p>
<h2>Like Us? Donate!</h2>

<p>It takes unpaid time to make these tutorials for you. If you wish to support us, we can continue to make high quality modding tutorials.</p>
<div id='note'>
<h2>Important Warning</h2>
<p>While modding can be fun, there is always the chance you can delete some code in a file that prevents the game from running completely or in certain aspects such as the ai. If you follow our instructions fully, this will not happen. Still keep in mind that we are not responsible for damage you do to your game files. If something happens that you have no backup for, simply reinstall the game and it will work like it did before.</p>
